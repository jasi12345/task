# task
 I created taskManagement app using Nextjs with spring boot. for database i use prisma with mongo db. 

 when You open my app first it will ask you to signin . if you are new user you need to log in to system .
 if you are login to system it will lead to profile page. In that project user profile will display. Also there 
 i added some certain tasks(All Task,Important task,complete Task,Do it now).base  on this task i create seperate page for these task.

 to create Task i create page for createContent. This page ask you fill form. If you filled that data that data will be stored in prisma . 
 So my brower not supported giving the output . because it showing me third party accessed blocked. so i added get,put,delete method inside my coding.
 i added filtering for eachpage. my work stopped at this level
